        <Dropdown summary="Will Liveboot modify my disks?">
            No. It will run entirely in RAM by default. Tools that write to
            disks ask for confirmation and are opt-in.
        </Dropdown>

        <Dropdown summary="What hardware is supported?">
            Anything a standard Linux kernel supports. We target modern x86-64
            and common Wi-Fi/Ethernet chipsets. ARM and RISC-V builds may
            follow.
        </Dropdown>

        <Dropdown summary="How big is the image and how fast does it boot?">
            We aim for a small footprint with fast, network-enabled boots. Exact
            sizes depend on enabled toolsets per release.
        </Dropdown>

        <Dropdown summary="Can I customize the toolset?">
            With a bit of fiddling, yes. The NixOS base allows you to build
            custom variants or enable extra modules.

        <Dropdown summary="Is Secure Boot supported?">
            Planned. We're working on signed artifacts and reproducible builds;
            roadmap will note progress.
